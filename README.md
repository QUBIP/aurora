## About

`aurora` provides a framework to build
[OpenSSL Providers][ossl:man:provider]
tailored for the transition to post-quantum cryptography.

[ossl:man:provider]: https://docs.openssl.org/3.2/man7/provider/

`aurora` showcases an approach we call "shallow loadable modules",
to enhance cryptographic agility
in order to adapt to the rapidly evolving ecosystem
of PQC algorithms and implementations:

- **_shallow_**: refers to the fact that we do not embed
  the cryptographic implementation within the Provider itself,
  but rather we depend on external implementations and provide
  decoupling between the OpenSSL library and your selection
  of external implementations;
- **_loadable modules_**: highlights that our design aims to produce
  modules that can be loaded at runtime into OpenSSL, to provide
  the desired functionality as needed, and seamlessly for OpenSSL
  and applications running on top of it.

### Supported algorithms

While we do not tightly couple with specific implementation choices,
at the moment we support a limited selection of algorithms
and external implementations through our `Adapters`.

The current supported algorithms are summarized in the following tables.

> [!NOTE]
> Future updates to aurora will expand its support
> for additional PQC algorithms
> and other external implementations.
